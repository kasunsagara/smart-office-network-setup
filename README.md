<h1>Smart Office Network Setup</h1>
<h3>A secure, scalable, and high-performance office network design</h3>
<br>

<h1>Project Description</h1>

<p>
This project presents a complete <b>Smart Office Network</b> designed and implemented using 
<b>Cisco Packet Tracer</b>. It focuses on creating a secure, scalable, and efficient network 
infrastructure suitable for contemporary office environments that require reliable connectivity, 
mobility, VoIP communication, and strong security controls. The project demonstrates how an 
enterprise-level office network can be planned, segmented, and optimized using industry-standard 
Cisco technologies.
</p>
<br>

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>
The smart office network is structured to support all essential business operations, including:<br><br>
• Wired and wireless connectivity<br>
• VoIP communication<br>
• Server access and resource management<br>
• Secure network segmentation<br><br>

The system includes VLAN-based department separation, secure Wi-Fi networks, dynamic routing, ACL-based 
security, device management, monitoring tools, and server infrastructure. This setup simulates a real 
enterprise office environment and demonstrates best practices in modern network design.
</p>
<br>

<h1>Features</h1>

<p>
• Multi-VLAN segmentation for departments<br>
• Secure inter-VLAN routing<br>
• NAT/PAT for internet access<br>
• Trunk links between router and switches<br>
• Centralized servers for file & web services<br>
• Guest Wi-Fi on isolated VLAN<br>
• Shared network printer in VLAN 20<br>
• End-to-end connectivity with cloud-simulated internet<br>
</p>
<br>

<h1>Network Topology</h1>

<p>
The network topology simulates a professional smart office environment with:<br><br>
• Core, Distribution, and Access layers<br>
• Multiple routers and switches<br>
• Wireless access points<br>
• VoIP phones for communication<br>
• Segmented departmental VLANs<br>
• Dedicated data center/server room<br><br>

The structure reflects real enterprise network architecture and supports both scalability 
and redundancy.
</p>
<br>

<h1>Objectives</h1>

<p>
• Practice enterprise-level Cisco networking concepts<br>
• Demonstrate real-world office network design<br>
• Apply secure and scalable configuration techniques<br>
• Improve routing, switching, and troubleshooting skills<br>
• Build a simulated office environment using Packet Tracer<br>
</p>
<br>

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>

<p>
• Cisco Packet Tracer<br>
• Cisco Layer 2 & Layer 3 switching<br>
• OSPF / EIGRP dynamic routing protocols<br>
• VLANs, ACLs, QoS, DHCP, DNS, STP<br>
• VoIP configuration with Call Manager Express<br>
• WPA2/WPA3 secure wireless networks<br>
</p>
<br>

<h1>About This Project</h1>

<p>
This project is designed for academic and educational purposes. It demonstrates how enterprise-level 
network architectures can be simulated and implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer. The system can be 
expanded by adding more departments, integrating firewalls, implementing VPNs, or introducing advanced 
network automation techniques.
